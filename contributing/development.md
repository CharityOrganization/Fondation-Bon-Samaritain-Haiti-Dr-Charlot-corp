# Development

This document describes the process for running this application on your local computer.

## Getting started

This site is powered by Node.js! :sparkles: :turtle: :rocket: :sparkles:

It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux environments.

You'll need Node.js version 12 or 14 to run the site. To install Node.js, [download the "LTS" installer from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). If you're using [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv), read the [`nodenv` docs](#nodenv) for instructions on switching Node.js versions.

Once you've installed Node.js (which includes the popular `npm` package manager), open Terminal and run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/github/docs
cd docs
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

You should now have a running server! Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. It will automatically restart as you make changes to site content.

When you're ready to stop your local server, type <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>c</kbd> in your terminal window.

Note that `npm run build` is a one-time step that create static assets.

## Site structure

This site was originally a Ruby on Rails web application. Some time later it was converted into a static site powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). A few years after that it was migrated to [Nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/), another Ruby static site generator.

Today it's a dynamic Node.js webserver powered by Express, using [middleware](../middleware/README.md) to support proper HTTP redirects, language header detection, and dynamic content generation to support the various flavors of GitHub's product documentation, like GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server.

The tooling for this site has changed over the years, but many of the tried-and-true authoring conventions of the original Jekyll site have been preserved:

- Content is written in Markdown files, which live in the `content` directory.
- Content can use the [Liquid templating language](liquid-helpers.md).
- Files in the `data` directory are available to templates via the `{% data %}` tag.
- Markdown files can contain [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter).
- The [`redirect_from`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) Jekyll plugin behavior is supported.
