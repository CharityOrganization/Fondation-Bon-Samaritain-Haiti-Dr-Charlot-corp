### About {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} permissions

{% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s are created with a set of permissions. Permissions define what resources the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} can access via the API. For more information, see "[Setting permissions for GitHub Apps](/apps/building-github-apps/setting-permissions-for-github-apps/)."

### Metadata permissions

GitHub Apps have the `Read-only` metadata permission by default. The metadata permission provides access to a collection of read-only endpoints with metadata for various resources. These endpoints do not leak sensitive private repository information.

Endpoints that allow operations on both issues and pull requests will be restricted to issues.
