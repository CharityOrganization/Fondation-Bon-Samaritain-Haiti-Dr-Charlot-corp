Users interact with repositories by commenting, opening issues, and creating pull requests. The Interactions APIs allow people with owner or admin access to temporarily restrict certain users from interacting with public repositories.

  {% unless operation.subcategory %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endunless %}
{% endfor %}

* {% data reusables.interactions.contributor-user-limit-definition %} in the organization.
* {% data reusables.interactions.collaborator-user-limit-definition %} in the organization.

  {% if operation.subcategory == 'orgs' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
