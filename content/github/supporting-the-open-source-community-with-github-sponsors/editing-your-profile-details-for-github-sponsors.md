### About sponsor profiles

Your {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} profile tells potential sponsors why they should support you. People see your sponsor profile when they click the **Sponsor** button on your personal or organization profile. We recommend including the following information.

- Open source work that you contribute to.
- Why you are committed to open source development.

You can also set goals to explain what different of levels of sponsorship will allow you to do for the community.
