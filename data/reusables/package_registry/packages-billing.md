{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} usage is free for public packages. For private packages, each {% data variables.product.product_name %} account receives a certain amount of free storage and data transfer, depending on the product used with the account. By default, your account will have a spending limit of $0, which prevents additional usage of storage or data transfer after you reach the included amounts. If you increase your spending limit above the default of $0, you will be billed for any additional storage or data transfer, also called overages, up to your spending limit. Any coupons on your account do not apply to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} overages.
