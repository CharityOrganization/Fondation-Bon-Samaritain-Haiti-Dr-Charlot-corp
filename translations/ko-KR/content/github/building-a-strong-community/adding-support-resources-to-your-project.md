To direct people to specific support resources, you can add a SUPPORT file to your repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's SUPPORT file.

You can create default support resources for your organization{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.19" %} or user account{% endif %}. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

**Tip:** To help people find your support guidelines, you can link to your SUPPORT file from other places in your repository, such as your [README file](/articles/about-readmes/).
