### About sponsoring developers and organizations

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorship-details %} {% data reusables.sponsors.no-fees %} For more information, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}](/articles/about-billing-for-github-sponsors)."

When you sponsor an open source contributor, the change will become effective immediately. {% data reusables.sponsors.prorated-sponsorship %}

If the sponsored open source contributor retires your tier, the tier will remain in place for you until you choose a different tier or cancel your subscription. For more information, see "[Upgrading a sponsorship](/articles/upgrading-a-sponsorship)" and "[Downgrading a sponsorship](/articles/downgrading-a-sponsorship)."

If the open source contributor you want to sponsor does not have a sponsored developer or organization profile, you can encourage the contributor to create a sponsored developer or organization profile. For more information, see "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your user account](/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-user-account)" and "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your organization](/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)."

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorships-not-tax-deductible %}

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} is not responsible for how developers represent themselves nor does {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} endorse any sponsored open source projects. The claims are solely the responsibility of the developer receiving the funds. Make sure you trust a person before offering a sponsorship. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} Additional Terms](/github/site-policy/github-sponsors-additional-terms).
