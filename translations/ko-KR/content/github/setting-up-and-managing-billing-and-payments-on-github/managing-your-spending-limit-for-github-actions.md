### About spending limits for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

{% data reusables.github-actions.actions-billing %} {% data reusables.github-actions.actions-spending-limit %}

You can set a higher spending limit or, for some accounts, allow unlimited spending. If you pay for your organization or enterprise account by invoice, you can prepay for overages to set a higher spending limit. The spending limit applies to your combined overages for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}. For more information about pricing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-github-actions)."

As soon as you set a spending limit above $0, you will be responsible for any overages that occurred in the past. For example, if your organization uses {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, does not allow overages, and creates workflow artifacts that increase your storage usage for the month from 1.9GB to 2.1GB, you will use slightly more storage than the 2GB your product includes.

Because you have not enabled overages, your next attempt to publish a version of the package will fail. You will not receive a bill for the 0.1GB overage that month. However, if you enable overages in a future month, your first bill will include the 0.1GB of overage from the past in addition to any overages for the current billing cycle.

### Managing the spending limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for your user account

Anyone can manage the spending limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for their own user account.

{% data reusables.user_settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.billing %}
{% data reusables.user_settings.cost-management-tab %}
{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.monthly-spending-limit %}
{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.update-spending-limit %}

### Managing the spending limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for your organization

Organizations owners and billing managers can manage the spending limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for an organization.

If you pay for your organization account by invoice, you cannot manage the spending limit for your enterprise account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. If you want to allow repositories owned by your organization to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} beyond the storage or data transfer included for each repository, you can prepay for overages. Because overages must prepaid, you cannot enable unlimited spending on accounts paid by invoice. Your spending limit will be 150% of the amount you prepaid. If you have any questions, [contact our account management team](https://enterprise.github.com/contact).
