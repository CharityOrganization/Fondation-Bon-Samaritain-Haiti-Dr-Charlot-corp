Repository administrators can require that all pull requests receive a specific number of approving reviews from people with *write* or *admin* permissions in the repository or from a designated code owner before they're merged into a protected branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/articles/about-protected-branches)."

When required reviews are enabled, anyone with access to the repository can approve changes in a pull request. However, you won't be able to merge your pull request until the required number of reviewers with *write* or *admin* permissions in the repository approve your pull request's changes in their review. For more information about repository permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)." If review is required from a designated code owner and the pull request affects code that has a designated owner, approval from that owner is required.
