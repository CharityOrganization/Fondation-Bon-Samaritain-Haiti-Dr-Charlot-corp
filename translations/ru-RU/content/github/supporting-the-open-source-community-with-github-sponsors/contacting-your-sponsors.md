Your sponsors can choose whether they receive email updates about your work. For more information, see "[Managing your sponsorship](/articles/managing-your-sponsorship)."

The update will come from your user account's primary email address or organization account's `noreply@github.com` email address. If you've enabled email address privacy on your user account, the update will come from `noreply@github.com` instead. For more information, see "[Setting your commit email address](/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address)."
