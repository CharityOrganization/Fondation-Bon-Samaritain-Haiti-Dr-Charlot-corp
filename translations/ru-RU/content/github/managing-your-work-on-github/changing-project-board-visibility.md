{% tip %}

**Tip:** When you make your project board public, organization members are given read access by default. You can give specific organization members write or admin permissions by giving project board access to teams they're on or by adding them to the project board as a collaborator. For more information, see "[Project board permissions for an organization](/articles/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."

{% endtip %}

1. Navigate to the project board you want to make public or private.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
{% data reusables.project-management.access-collaboration-settings %}
4. Under "Visibility", select **Public** or **Private**. Then, click **Save**. ![Public and private radio buttons](/assets/images/help/projects/project-board-visibility-options.png)
