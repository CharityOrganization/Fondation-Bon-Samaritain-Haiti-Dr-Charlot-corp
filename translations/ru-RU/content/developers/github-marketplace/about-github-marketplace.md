#### Unverified Apps

Unverified apps do not need to meet the "[Requirements for listing an app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](/marketplace/getting-started/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/)" or go through the "[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/)".

{% data reusables.marketplace.unverified-apps %} Having a published paid plan will prevent you from being able to submit an unverified app. You must remove paid plans or keep them in draft mode before publishing an unverified app.

To list your unverified app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, you only need to create a "[Listing on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](/marketplace/listing-on-github-marketplace/)" and submit it as an unverified listing.
