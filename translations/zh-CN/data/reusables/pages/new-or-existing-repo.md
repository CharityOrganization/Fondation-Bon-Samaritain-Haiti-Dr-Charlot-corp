如果站点是一个独立的项目，您可以创建新仓库来存储站点源代码。 If your site is associated with an existing project, you can add the source code {% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.22" or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}to that project's repository, in a `/docs` folder on the default branch or on a different branch.{% else %}for your site to a `gh-pages` branch or a `docs` folder on the `master` branch in that project's repository.{% endif %} For example, if you're creating a site to publish documentation for a project that's already on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you may want to store the source code for the site in the same repository as the project.

如果要在现有仓库中创建站点，请跳至“[创建站点](#creating-your-site)”一节。
